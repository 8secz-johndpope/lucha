# LUCHA

[Live Demo]() (https://lucha-app.herokuapp.com)

Lucha is an activity tracking website inspired by Strava. It uses a
Rails/PostgreSQL backend, React.js and Redux on the frontend,
and the Google Maps API for map interactivity. 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

* Working code - ready to push to Heroku
